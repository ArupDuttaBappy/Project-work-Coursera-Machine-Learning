# Project-work-Coursera-Machine-Learning
This repository is dedicated to showcase my works on machine learning models. From basic building, optimizing techniques to machine learning models and intelligent classifiers. Though these codes are basically in Matlab programming language, Python versions are also available in other repositories.
<br>I have attached all my codes that were written by me when doing machine learning course on Coursera.<br>
Anyone can try out these codes for their own purpose.
