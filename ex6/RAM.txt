The neural
network will be able to represent complex models that form non-linear hy-
potheses.
feedforward
propagation algorithm to use our weights for prediction.
the backpropagation algorithm for neural
networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.

In the 3rd exercise, you implemented feedforward propagation for neu-
ral networks and used it to predict handwritten digits with the weights we
provided. In the 4th exercise, you will implement the backpropagation algorithm
to learn the parameters for the neural network.
